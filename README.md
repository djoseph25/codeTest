Write a one-page app that uses a photo search API via AJAX to search for images and display them.  

Suggested services Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/documentation#search-photos).

1.  The images should be in a vertically scrolling area and the search field should stay on the screen.  
2.  When the user hits enter or presses the search button, it should refresh the display with the new results.  
3.  Show the first 20 images.
4.  Images in the scrolling areas should be displayed as large as possible, while still fitting on-screen fully.
